Solves hte brick wall problem. Consider the problem of building a wall out of 2 x 1 and 3 x 1 bricks (horizontal x vertial dimensions) 
such that, for extra strength, the gaps between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive layers, i.e. never form a "running crack".

The problem is to find the number of different ways to forming a crack-free wall for a given width and height. 

Run the java program and input the arguemnts - width and height of the wall. for e.g. to get the result of 9 x 3 wall starrt the program like this - "java Main.java 9 3"
